## What I Learned
- Learned `bcryptjs` to hash password
- Learned to use `config` for development and for production to be able to deploy to heroku
- Learned `express-validator` to validate inputs from user before passing data into mongoDB
- Learned `jsonwebtoken` to pass private tokens into local storage to be able to access private routes
